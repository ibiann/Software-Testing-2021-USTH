#  1.1 What are some factors that would help a development organization move from Beizerâ€™s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality)?

## Level 2 to level 3:
 In Level 2 testing, the purpose is to show failures. So, the thinking that leads to Level 3 testing starts with the realization that testing can show the presence, but not the absence, of failures. This lets us accept the fact that whenever we use software, we incur some risk.
 In level 3 testing, both testers and developers work together to reduce risk.
## Level 3 to level 4:
 Level 4 thinking defines testing as a mental discipline that increases quality. Various ways exist to increase quality, of which creating
tests that cause the software to fail is only one. 
  level 4 testing means that the purpose of testing is to improve the ability of the developers to produce high quality software.
