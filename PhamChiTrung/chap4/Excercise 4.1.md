Remember that in TDD, the tests determine the requirements. This
means you must encode decisions such as whether the division
method returns an integer or a floating point number in automated
tests before modifying the software.Submit printouts of all tests, your final version of Calc, and a
screenshot showing that all tests pass. Most importantly, include 
a narrative describing each TDD test created, the changes needed to
make it pass, and any refactoring that was necessary.
